  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data from various online sources using Python. 
    The workflow begins with web scraping using BeautifulSoup to collect raw data from HTML pages. 
    The data is then processed and structured using Pandas, including handling missing values, normalizing formats, and merging datasets.
    Finally, the cleaned data is visualized using a combination of  Plotly to uncover trends, correlations, and insights.
    The goal is to demonstrate a full data pipeline from acquisition to visualization, suitable for real-world analytical tasks.
